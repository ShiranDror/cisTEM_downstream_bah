Individual recipes for image processing using the tools available in cisTEM are provided in the sub-directories, modelled after the samples in the CUDA toolkit.

Initially, there is no provisioning for compilation of these individual programs, instead, they will all be compiled into samples_functional_testing.cpp

0_Simple
  * Goal is to illustrate how applications are built in cisTEM

1_Utilities
  * Illustrate tools built in useful for programming in cisTEM, such as timers, debug asserts, etc.

2_Imaging
  * Small programs to isolate common image procesing tasks
  * Each example will cover the cpu (.cpp) and gpu (.cu) implementation
